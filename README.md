## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**shepi13/shepi13** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->
#### Current projects:
- **[C Compiler](https://github.com/shepi13/shepi-c-compiler)**
  - C compiler written in rust
- **[Shepichess](https://github.com/shepi13/shepichess-website)**
  - Personal website for my chess coaching, written in react/typescript using nextJS
  - Includes support for engine analysis, blog posts using mdx, a full pgn viewer, and more
  - Will be hosted as a static site on AWS S3 when completed
- **[Chess Engine](https://github.com/shepi13/dssheph2-chess-engine)**
  - Chess engine written in C for one of my college courses (a long time ago)
  - It's not very strong, and the code is a bit low quality and dated, but probably is still one of the most fun projects I've worked on

Other projects I've worked on include writing a twitch chat bot in python for my chess streams, writing a professional website using pure HTML/CSS/Javascript,
and writing a script to analyze images from a microscope for college graduate research.

I've also worked on many smaller projects ranging from small games to simple data analysis/scraping scripts.
